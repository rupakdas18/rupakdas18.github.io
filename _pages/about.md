My name is Rupak Kumar Das, and I am a Ph.D. student at the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Pennsylvania State University. I am currently a trainee in the NRT LINDIV graduate traineeship program.

My research interests lie in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and social media analysis. I have always been fascinated by the power of language and its ability to connect people from different backgrounds and cultures. As a graduate student, I have had the opportunity to delve deeper into these fields, and I am excited about the potential for my work to impact society positively.

I completed my Master's (2022) in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) and my Bachelor's (2015) in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (KUET).

Previously, I worked as a Technology Division Specialist for Robi Axiata Limited (2017-2020) and a Former Solution Engineer at Huawei Technology Bangladesh Ltd. (2015-2017) in the Sales and Solutions Department.
